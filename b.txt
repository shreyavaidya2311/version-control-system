              The first round was an aptitude test of 1 and a half hour on

              </li>
              <li>
                There were 3 Sections – Quant, Technical and Coding. any
                remaining time from the previous section will roll over into the
                next section.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quant (20 mins) – 20 Questions based on general aptitude. This
                part was pretty easy.

              <li>
                Technical MCQs (15 mins) – 15 Questions based on Predict output,

                Coding (45 mins) – There were 2 Questions. I don’t exactly
                remember the first question but it was based on breadth-first
                search of graph. The second question was given n dice with
                different letters printed on it and string. Find the number of
                ways to obtain the string from dice throws.
              </li>

            <br />
            <i>Technical Round 1: (Approx. 45 mins)</i>
            <br />
            The interview started with a brief introduction. This round was
            mostly focused on a coding question. The coding question was:
            <br />
            Let the starting position of the frog be 0 and he wants to go to
            position n. K is the max number of jumps that can be made forward by
            the frog. Count the total number of ways to cover the distance.
            Consider, n = 4 and k = 2 Then number of ways are 4 Which are (1, 1,
            1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1).
            <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-of-ways-to-cover-a-distance/">
              Pretty similar to this one.

            In the end, the interviewer also asked about the difference between
            Static and dynamic memory allocation.

            <i>Technical Round 2: (Approx. 1 hr)</i>
            <br />
            This round was based on knowledge of the core CS subjects. The
            interviewer started with OOPS (Object – oriented programming) and
            then moved to Operating System and Computer networks. Some of the
            questions were:
            <div style={{ marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
              <li>Four pillars of OOPS.</li>

            <i> Technical Round 3: (Approx. 1hr)</i>
            <br />
            This round started with a discussion on my projects. They asked me
            about features in my projects which they found interesting? Why you
            chose a particular project? What is the future scope of the project?
            After the discussion on projects, they again moved to technical
            questions.
            <br />
            Questions:
            <div style={{ marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
              <li>
                What is PWA (Progressive web application)? Procedure to make a
                particular web application a PWA? What are the benefits of it?
                (These questions were asked because I mentioned PWA in my
                resume)

            </div>
            <br />
            <i>HR Round: (Approx. 15 mins)</i>
            This round was a bit candid than previous technical rounds. Some of
            the questions were:
            <div style={{ marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
              <li>Introduce Yourself</li>
              <li>Family background and place</li>

              resume?

            <br />I would say a lot. As I mentioned, they ask about features in
            your app which they find interesting. One of my android apps had a
            Wifi-P2P feature. So, they asked me questions like how it works,
            what libraries you used, why you preferred it over P2P using
            Bluetooth.

            <li style={{ marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
              Prefer C++ or Python over C as these languages provide you with
              many utility functions and libraries which saves lot of time
            </li>
            <li style={{ marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
              If you are unable to solve a question, at least try to clear some
              test cases in the coding section of an aptitude test
            </li>
            <li style={{ marginLeft: "2.5rem" }}>
              Take your time while solving questions in the interview. Clarify
              the questions with the interviewer. Try to find a brute force
              solution first and then try to optimize it. Explain your approach
              to the interviewer while writing code
